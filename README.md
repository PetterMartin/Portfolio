My portfolio website designed to showcase myself as a developer and the projects I have created so far after 1 year at Noroff.

## Description

This website is my personal portfolio and is to give you an insight into who I am as a person and developer. What my style is, what I like and how I work. 
I have chosen orange, white, and black as my primary colors as I feel they give off a warm, playful yet professional vibe that I feel encapsulates me as a person.
Below I have listed in order what you will find on my webpage and what purpose they serve.

- A hero section with my name and a picture of me
- A list of the programming languages used to develop this and my other webpages
- A list of goals I aim for when designing my websites. 
- My projects. here you can visit the project to see how it looks and you can also go to the github to see the code.
- At last there is the contact page with my e-mail and a contact button to make it easy to just send a quick mail.
